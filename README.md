# Causal Inference and Machine Learning

This repository is dedicated to exploring the fundamental concepts of causal inference and their applications in machine learning. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how causal reasoning can enhance data-driven models, bridging the gap between statistical correlation and causation.

## Overview

Causal inference is a powerful tool that allows us to understand not just whether variables are associated, but whether one variable actually causes another. This repository covers key theoretical frameworks, methods, and applications essential for mastering causal inference in the context of machine learning.

## Topics Covered

1. **Probabilistic Graphical Models and Structural Causal Models**  
   Learn how to represent causal relationships using probabilistic graphical models and structural causal models, providing the foundation for causal reasoning.

2. **Confounders, Colliders, and Mediators**  
   Dive into the core concepts of causal diagrams and understand the differences between causal and spurious correlations. Explore how these elements affect the causal interpretation of data.

3. **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**  
   Explore the gold standard of causal inferenceâ€”randomized controlled trials. Understand when conditional and interventional distributions align, how to actively collect data, and the limitations of RCTs.

4. **Causal Inference from Observational Data**  
   Delve into advanced techniques like Inverse Probability Weighting, Doubly Robust Estimation, Matching, Instrumental Variables, Difference-in-Differences, and Regression Discontinuity for inferring causality from non-experimental data.

5. **Distributional Shift in Machine Learning**  
   Examine how distributional shifts impact machine learning models and discover causal approaches to address these challenges. Topics include invariance, stable correlations, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning.

## Methodology

To maximize learning, each topic will be presented through:
- **Detailed Readings**: Foundational texts and papers that provide the theoretical basis for each topic.
- **Examples and Code**: Practical examples with code to demonstrate causal inference techniques in action.
- **Exercises**: Hands-on exercises to reinforce understanding and application of the concepts.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/causal-inference-ml.git
